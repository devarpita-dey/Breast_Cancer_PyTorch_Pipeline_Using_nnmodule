# Breast_Cancer_PyTorch_Pipeline_Using_nnmodule
This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline for building, training, and evaluating neural networks using PyTorch's nn.Module. The project includes essential components like model definition, data preprocessing, training loops, evaluation metrics, and inference. 
**Features**
Custom Neural Network Architecture: Built using PyTorch's nn.Module, including activation functions and layers like nn.Linear.

Training Pipeline: Implements forward propagation, loss calculation, backward propagation, and parameter updates.

Evaluation: Includes functionality to calculate metrics like accuracy during inference with torch.no_grad().

Data Type Handling: Ensures compatibility by managing tensor data types (float32).

Configurable Hyperparameters: Easily modify learning rates, epochs, and other training parameters.

**Highlights**

Example code demonstrates how to:
Train a binary classification model.
Use PyTorch optimizers like SGD.
Avoid common runtime errors such as mismatched data types.
Clear and structured approach to writing reusable PyTorch training scripts
